# Heart_disease_prediction
Developed a machine learning-based heart disease prediction system using Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. Performed model comparison using accuracy, precision, recall. Designed a Streamlit app for user-friendly prediction interface.

# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction App

This project is a simple web app that predicts whether a person might have heart disease based on their health information. It was built using machine learning and an easy-to-use interface with Streamlit.

## 🔍 What This Project Does

- Takes basic health inputs like age, blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.
- Predicts the chance of heart disease using trained machine learning models
- Lets users interact with the app and see results instantly

## 🛠 How It Was Made

- Trained and tested different machine learning models (like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and SVM)
- Compared which model worked best
- Saved the best model and used it inside a Streamlit app
